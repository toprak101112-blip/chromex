Chromex is a Chrome MV3 side-panel assistant that connects Chrome to Codex through a local native bridge. It helps users work with the current page, selected tabs, uploaded files, voice input, images, and browser workflows while keeping credentials out of extension storage.

Published by **GenexisAI CHOI**.

## What It Does

- Chat with the current webpage, selected open tabs, screenshots, uploaded files, PDFs, Office files, images, and browser history when requested.
- Summarize and compare page content, YouTube videos, news articles, research pages, PDFs, and arXiv papers.
- Edit or generate images through Codex image workflows with local output handling.
- Use voice transcription, live voice mode, page-aware suggestions, custom profiles, and optional Codex skills.
- Run browser-control workflows through Chrome content scripts with visible in-page activity indicators.

## Install In 5 Minutes

Fastest path for users:

1. Open the [latest GitHub Release](https://github.com/GENEXIS-AI/chromex/releases/latest).
2. Download [`chromex-unpacked-extension.zip`](https://github.com/GENEXIS-AI/chromex/releases/latest/download/chromex-unpacked-extension.zip) from the release assets.
3. Unzip it.
4. Open `chrome://extensions`.
5. Enable **Developer mode**.
6. Select **Load unpacked** and choose the unzipped `chromex-extension` folder.
7. Open Chromex from the Chrome toolbar or side panel and follow onboarding.

Release ZIP files are attached to GitHub Releases. They are not committed into the repository file tree. If the direct download link does not open, use the [latest release page](https://github.com/GENEXIS-AI/chromex/releases/latest) and download `chromex-unpacked-extension.zip` from **Assets**.

Developer source install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GENEXIS-AI/chromex.git
cd chromex
npm install
npm run build
node scripts/install-native-host.mjs
```

Then open `chrome://extensions`, enable **Developer mode**, select **Load unpacked**, and choose:

```text
packages/extension/dist
```

## Runtime Boundary

Chromex uses this boundary:

```text
Chrome Extension -> Native Messaging Host -> Local Bridge -> codex app-server
```

The source tree is organized as:

- `packages/extension`: Chrome MV3 side-panel extension
- `packages/bridge`: local bridge daemon for Codex app-server and multimodal workflows
- `packages/native-host`: Chrome Native Messaging relay
- `packages/shared`: shared types, policies, profiles, and helpers

## Language Support

Chromex follows the browser language automatically by default. Users can also choose a language in **Settings > General > App UI language**.

The extension ships Chrome `_locales` entries for English, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Arabic, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Hindi, Vietnamese, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and many other Chrome-compatible locales. Model responses are instructed to follow the selected UI language unless the user asks for another language.

## Security And Privacy Defaults

- The extension does not store raw OpenAI API keys, OAuth tokens, or ChatGPT session tokens in Chrome extension storage.
- Codex OAuth / ChatGPT login is handled through the local Codex app-server flow.
- API-key login is an optional local fallback and is never used automatically without user confirmation.
- Page content, tab data, screenshots, browser history, microphone input, and browser actions are used only for user-requested workflows.
- `history`, `tabs`, screen capture, microphone, and site access are requested only when a feature needs them.
- Conversation history is session-only by default. Persistent local chat history is opt-in.
- Native-host child processes and workspace hooks run with a reduced environment allowlist.
- Generated image originals, temporary uploads, and diagnostics are handled by the local bridge.

Read [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) and [PRIVACY.md](./PRIVACY.md) before publishing or deploying a modified build.

## Features

- Persistent MV3 side panel with chat-first UX.
- Automatic routing for page, file, image, history, voice, and browser-control requests.
- `@` picker for selecting one or more open tabs.
- `/` picker for profile selection.
- Attachments for images, text, PDF, DOCX, CSV, TSV, XLSX, and XLSM.
- Read strategy policy for DOM, vision, hybrid, and site-adapter workflows.
- Site-aware suggestions for YouTube, news, research, mail, collaboration, notes, task tools, shopping, travel, and Korean work services.
- YouTube adapter with current timestamp context and seek actions.
- Non-destructive image editing for uploaded images, page images, or visible screen captures.
- Markdown rendering with code blocks, tables, links, and copy controls.
- Optional Codex skills loaded from a user's local `.codex/skills/*/SKILL.md` only when enabled.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm run test
npm run build
npm run release:audit
```

Optional browser smoke test:

```bash
npm run smoke
```

If no compatible browser exists, install the Playwright Chromium runtime:

```bash
npm run smoke:install-browser
```

The built extension is emitted to:

```text
packages/extension/dist
```

## Chrome Web Store Package

Create an upload-ready extension zip:

```bash
npm run package:webstore
```

The command rebuilds the extension, stages `packages/extension/dist`, removes the unpacked-install `manifest.key`, strips source maps and local build metadata, validates the zip, and writes the package to `output/chrome-web-store/`.

## Public Source Release

Create sanitized public release artifacts:

```bash
npm run package:public
```

This writes two artifacts under `output/public-release/`:

- `chromex-*-public-source-*.zip`: source archive for GitHub publication.
- `chromex-*-unpacked-extension-*.zip`: ready-to-unzip Chrome Developer Mode package. After unzip, select the `chromex-extension` folder in **Load unpacked**.
- `chromex-public-source.zip` and `chromex-unpacked-extension.zip`: stable asset names for GitHub Release direct-download links.

## Release Management

Chromex uses normal open-source release history from `0.1.1` onward. Versioning, pull request flow, and release checklist are documented in [RELEASE.md](./RELEASE.md).

## Troubleshooting

- **Native host missing or forbidden**: run `npm run build`, then `node scripts/install-native-host.mjs`, reload the extension in `chrome://extensions`, and check Chromex onboarding/system status.
- **Model list does not load**: confirm the native bridge is connected, then sign in through the app-server-backed login flow.
- **Page context is unavailable**: open Chromex from the target tab or approve the Chrome site permission prompt when the workflow requests access.
- **Chrome still shows old UI**: run `npm run build`, reload the extension card, and confirm Chrome is loading `packages/extension/dist`.
- **Browser smoke test fails because no browser exists**: run `npm run smoke:install-browser`, then `npm run smoke`.
