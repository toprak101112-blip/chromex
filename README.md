Chromex is a Chrome MV3 side-panel assistant that connects Chrome to Codex through a local native bridge. It helps users work with the current page, selected tabs, uploaded files, voice input, images, and browser workflows while keeping credentials out of extension storage.

Published by **GenexisAI CHOI**.

## What It Does

- Chat with the current webpage, selected open tabs, screenshots, uploaded files, PDFs, Office files, images, and browser history when requested.
- Summarize and compare page content, YouTube videos, news articles, research pages, PDFs, and arXiv papers.
- Edit or generate images through Codex image workflows with local output handling.
- Use voice transcription, live voice mode, page-aware suggestions, custom profiles, and optional Codex skills.
- Run browser-control workflows through Chrome content scripts with visible in-page activity indicators.

## Install From Source

GitHub Releases publish source code only. They do not ship a separate `chromex-extension` unpacked-extension ZIP because users were mixing that browser UI folder with the source folder and running `npm install` where no `package.json` exists.

Use the source checkout or [`chromex-public-source.zip`](https://github.com/GENEXIS-AI/chromex/releases/latest/download/chromex-public-source.zip):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GENEXIS-AI/chromex.git
cd chromex
npm install
npm run build
node scripts/install-native-host.mjs
```

Then open `chrome://extensions`, enable **Developer mode**, select **Load unpacked**, and choose:

```text
packages/extension/dist
```

Important: run `npm install`, `npm run build`, and `install-native-host.mjs` from the `chromex` source folder that contains `package.json`. If Windows reports `ENOENT Could not read package.json`, you are in the wrong folder.

### Windows Local Bridge Setup

On Windows, install Node.js 20 LTS or newer, then install and verify the Codex CLI first:

```powershell
npm install -g @openai/codex
codex --version
```

Use the npm install path above even if `winget install Codex -s msstore` fails. `0x8a15005e: The server certificate did not match any of the expected values` is a Windows Store / TLS certificate-chain problem outside Chromex, not a Chromex install step.

Then use **PowerShell** from the `chromex` source folder:

```powershell
npm install
npm run build
node scripts/install-native-host.mjs --browser=chrome
```

Then open `chrome://extensions`, click **Reload** on Chromex, and press **Check connection** in the Chromex side panel.

If the side panel still says the local bridge is waiting:

1. Confirm Chromex is loaded from `packages/extension/dist`.
2. Copy the extension ID shown on the Chromex card in `chrome://extensions`.
3. Re-run the installer with that ID:

```powershell
node scripts/install-native-host.mjs <extension-id> --browser=chrome
```

The expected public release ID is `menmlhahmendmkiicbjihgjhppkgaeom`. If Chrome shows a different ID, use the ID shown in Chrome.

If login fails with `Failed to start codex app-server`, Chromex can reach the local bridge but cannot start the Codex CLI. Re-run `codex --version`. If Windows cannot find it, set the optional Codex binary path to `%APPDATA%\npm\codex.cmd`, or set the folder to `%APPDATA%\npm`. Do not put your workspace folder in the Codex binary field; the workspace folder and Codex executable path are separate settings.

## Runtime Boundary

Chromex uses this boundary:

```text
Chrome Extension -> Native Messaging Host -> Local Bridge -> codex app-server
```

The source tree is organized as:

- `packages/extension`: Chrome MV3 side-panel extension
- `packages/bridge`: local bridge daemon for Codex app-server and multimodal workflows
- `packages/native-host`: Chrome Native Messaging relay
- `packages/shared`: shared types, policies, profiles, and helpers

## Language Support

Chromex follows the browser language automatically by default. Users can also choose a language in **Settings > General > App UI language**.

The extension ships Chrome `_locales` entries for English, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Arabic, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Hindi, Vietnamese, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and many other Chrome-compatible locales. Model responses are instructed to follow the selected UI language unless the user asks for another language.

## Security And Privacy Defaults

- The extension does not store raw OpenAI API keys, OAuth tokens, or ChatGPT session tokens in Chrome extension storage.
- Codex OAuth / ChatGPT login is handled through the local Codex app-server flow.
- API-key login is an optional local fallback and is never used automatically without user confirmation.
- Page content, tab data, screenshots, browser history, microphone input, and browser actions are used only for user-requested workflows.
- `history`, `tabs`, screen capture, microphone, and site access are requested only when a feature needs them.
- Conversation history is session-only by default. Persistent local chat history is opt-in.
- Native-host child processes and workspace hooks run with a reduced environment allowlist.
- Generated image originals, temporary uploads, and diagnostics are handled by the local bridge.

Read [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) and [PRIVACY.md](./PRIVACY.md) before publishing or deploying a modified build.

## Features

- Persistent MV3 side panel with chat-first UX.
- Automatic routing for page, file, image, history, voice, and browser-control requests.
- `@` picker for selecting one or more open tabs.
- `/` picker for profile selection.
- Attachments for images, text, PDF, DOCX, CSV, TSV, XLSX, and XLSM.
- Read strategy policy for DOM, vision, hybrid, and site-adapter workflows.
- Site-aware suggestions for YouTube, news, research, mail, collaboration, notes, task tools, shopping, travel, and Korean work services.
- YouTube adapter with current timestamp context and seek actions.
- Non-destructive image editing for uploaded images, page images, or visible screen captures.
- Markdown rendering with code blocks, tables, links, and copy controls.
- Optional Codex skills loaded from a user's local `.codex/skills/*/SKILL.md` only when enabled.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm run test
npm run build
npm run release:audit
```

Optional browser smoke test:

```bash
npm run smoke
```

If no compatible browser exists, install the Playwright Chromium runtime:

```bash
npm run smoke:install-browser
```

The built extension is emitted to:

```text
packages/extension/dist
```

## Release Management

Chromex uses normal open-source release history from `0.1.1` onward. Versioning, pull request flow, and release checklist are documented in [RELEASE.md](./RELEASE.md).

## Troubleshooting

- **Native host missing or forbidden**: run `npm run build`, then `node scripts/install-native-host.mjs --browser=chrome`, reload the extension in `chrome://extensions`, and check Chromex onboarding/system status. If Chrome shows a different extension ID, run `node scripts/install-native-host.mjs <extension-id> --browser=chrome`.
- **Model list does not load**: confirm the native bridge is connected, then sign in through the app-server-backed login flow.
- **Page context is unavailable**: open Chromex from the target tab or approve the Chrome site permission prompt when the workflow requests access.
- **Chrome still shows old UI**: run `npm run build`, reload the extension card, and confirm Chrome is loading `packages/extension/dist`.
- **Browser smoke test fails because no browser exists**: run `npm run smoke:install-browser`, then `npm run smoke`.
